There were also 43 card pre-priced packs ($1.49) which contained Rookie Sensation inserts. The fronts feature a color action player photo, with a white inner border and a two-color (red on top and bottom, blue on sides) outer border on a white card face. The team logo is superimposed at the upper left corner of the picture, with the player’s name and position appearing below the picture. The backs are printed in black, gray, and yellow, and present biographical and statistical information. The set is ordered alphabetically in team subsets (with a few exceptions due to late trades). The description, All-American, is properly capitalized on the back of cards 134 and 144, but is not capitalized on cards 20, 29, 51, 53, 59, 70, 119, 130, 178, and 192. Rookie Cards of note in the set include Nick Anderson, Mookie Blaylock, Vlade Divac, Sean Elliott, Tim Hardaway, Shawn Kemp, Glen Rice, and Clifford Robinson."

The Slam Dunk subset is divided into five categories: Power, Grace, Champions, Little Big Men, and Great Defenders. Randomly inserted throughout the packs were more than 3,000 (Slam Dunk subset) cards signed by former NBA players Darryl Dawkins and Kenny Walker as well as by current NBA star Shawn Kemp. According to Fleer’s advertising material, odds of finding a signed Slam Dunk card are one in 5,000 packs. Rookie Cards of note include Tom Gugliotta, Robert Horry, Christian Laettner, Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O’Neal, Latrell Sprewell and Clarence Weatherspoon. A second series mail-in offer featuring an “All-Star Slam Dunk Team” card and an issue of Inside Stuff was available (expiring 6/30/93) in return for ten second series wrappers plus a dollar."

The player’s name, team, and position appear in team-colored lettering set on an irregular team-colored foil patch at the lower left. The black-bordered back carries a color player action shot on the left side, with the player’s name, biography, team logo, and statistics displayed on a team-colored background on the right. The cards are numbered on the back and grouped alphabetically within teams. Unlike previous years, there were no subset cards featured in this set. Each pack contained at least one insert card. One in every 72 packs (Hot Packs) contained only inserts. Rookie Cards of note in this set include Grant Hill, Juwan Howard, Eddie Jones, Jason Kidd and Glenn Robinson."

Unlike the American cards, basic issue cards were placed in team order alphabetically by the city. Also, unlike the American issue, the cards are not numbered as a continuation of the first series. The second series set was numbered 1-200, which may create some confusion for collectors who have obtained both first and second series cards.

Basic player cards feature blue-bordered metallic fronts and cut-out action shots set against a swirling court background. The Rookie subset cards (111-139) feature orange-bordered cards. Magic Johnson’s card (#252) was added very late in the production schedule and unlike other player cards features a red border on front instead of blue. The checklist card (#111) has an uncorrected error – it should have been numbered 140 as the last card in the first series. Also, card #251, originally scheduled to be a checklist for the second series set, was never printed. Each card features an opaque coating that can be carefully peeled off designed to protect the card front from problems that may arise from handling. Values provided below are for unpeeled cards. Peeled cards generally trade for ten to twenty-five percent less. Noteworthy Rookie Cards include Michael Finley, Kevin Garnett, Joe Smith, Jerry Stackhouse and Damon Stoudamire."

Each game piece was a multiple choice trivia card about basketball. The collector would scratch off the box next to the answer that they felt best matched the question to determine if they won. Instant win game pieces were also inserted one in 72 packs. Winning game pieces could be sent into Upper Deck for a prize drawing. The Grand Prize was a chance to meet Michael Jordan.

The set does contain 270 cards, but is essentially a 90-card set with each player having three different front themes: Row 2 (Style), Row 1 (Grace) and Row 0 (Showcase). Each card also contains the following back themes: Showtime, Show Stoppers and Showpiece. By combining the two different themes, collectors can determine the different scarcity levels. For Row 2, or Style, using Style and Showtime (cards 1-30), the odds are 1.5 to one. Using Style and Showpiece (cards 31-60), the odds are one in 2. Using Style and Show Stoppers (cards 61-90), the odds are one in 1.5. A three-card promo strip of Jerry Stackhouse was released and is priced at the end of the set."
